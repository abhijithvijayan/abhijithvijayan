Hey there 👋,

I create and maintain open source packages mainly for node.js and web development. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as public as possible.  You can see a full list of what I am up to on [abhijithvijayan.in](https://abhijithvijayan.in). If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a [tip](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/abhijithvijayan), give me a shout out [@_abhijithv](https://twitter.com/_abhijithv), or give some ♥ on [paypal](https://www.paypal.me/iamabhijithvijayan).
